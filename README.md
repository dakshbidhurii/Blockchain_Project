# IncomeShareAgreement

## Vision

The Income Share Agreement (ISA) smart contract is designed to provide a decentralized and trustless method for funding education or training programs. The contract enables a student to receive financial support in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of their future income with the funder. By leveraging blockchain technology, the ISA ensures transparency, automation, and security in managing income-sharing agreements.

## Project Features

- **Income Sharing**: The student shares a fixed percentage of their income with the funder over a predefined period.
- **Automated Payment Tracking**: The contract calculates the payment based on the student's monthly income and keeps a record of the total amount paid.
- **Contract Termination**: The funder has the authority to terminate the contract at any time if needed.
- **Duration Check and Closure**: The contract includes functionality to check if the payment duration has ended and allows the funder to close the contract once the time is up.
- **Transparency**: All payments and contract terminations are logged through events, ensuring transparency and auditability.

## Future Scope

- **Income Verification**: Integrate with external oracles or APIs to automatically verify the student's incomes.
- **Flexible Payment Terms**: Implement features to adjust the income share percentage or payment duration based on predefined conditions, such as changes in the student's financial situation.
- **Multiple Funders**: Expand the contract to allow multiple funders to contribute and share the student's income proportionally.
- **Escrow Mechanism**: Introduce an escrow service that holds payments until certain conditions are met, adding an extra layer of security.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Adapt the contract to be deployable on multiple blockchain networks, enabling broader accessibility.

## Project Structure

- **`contracts/`**: Contains the Solidity smart contract.
  - `IncomeShareAgreement.sol`: The main contract responsible for managing the income-sharing agreement between the student and the funder.
- **`migrations/`**: Scripts to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.
- **`test/`**: Unit tests for the smart contract to ensure all functions behave as expected.
  - `IncomeShareAgreement.test.js`: JavaScript test file containing tests for income payments, contract termination, and duration checks.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides an overview of the project, its vision, features, and structure.
- **`truffle-config.js`**: Configuration file for the Truffle framework used to deploy and test the smart contract.
